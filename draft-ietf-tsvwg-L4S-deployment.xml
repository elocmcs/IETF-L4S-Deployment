		<t>The IETF's Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG) has finalized experimental RFCs for Low Latency, 
		Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S) and Non-Queue-Building (NQB) per hop behavior <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-l4s-arch"/> 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-aqm-dualq-coupled"/> <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id"/> 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-l4sops"/> <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb"/> 
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-dscp-considerations"/>. These documents do a good job of describing 
		a new architecture and protocol for deploying low latency networking. 
		But as is normal for many such standards, especially those in 
		experimental status, certain design decisions are ultimately left to implementers.</t>
		
		<t>This document explores the potential implications of key deployment design decisions and makes 
		recommendations for those decisions that may help drive adoption. In particular, there are best practices based on prior experience 
		as a network operator that should be considered and there are network neutrality types of considerations 
		as well. These technologies are benign on their own, but the way they are operationally implemented can 
		determine whether they are ultimately perceived positively and adopted by the broader Internet ecosystem. 
		That is a key issue for low latency networking, because the more applications developers and edge platforms that adopt 
		new packet marking for low latency traffic, then the greater the value to end users, so ensuring it is received well 
		is key to driving strong initial adoption.</t>
		
		<t>It is worth stating though that these decisions are not embedded in or inherent to L4S and NQB per se, but are decisions 
		that can change depending upon differing technical, regulatory, business or other requirements. Even two network operators with the 
		same type of access technology in the same market area may choose to implement in different ways. Nevertheless, this document 
		suggests that certain specific deployment decisions can help maximize the value of low latency networking to both users and 
		network operators.</t> 
		
		<t>It is also apparent from the IETF's work that it is clear that nearly all modern application types need low latency 
			to some degree and that applications are best positioned to express their needs via application code and packet marking. 
			Furthermore, unlike with bandwidth priority on a highly/fully utilized link, low latency is not a zero sum game - everyone 
			can potentially have lower latency at no one else's expense.</t>
		
		<t>For additional background on latency and why latency matters so much to the Internet, please read <xref target="BITAG"/></t>

	    </section>
	    
	    <section title="A New Understanding of Application Needs">
		    
		    
		    
		    <t>In the course of working to improve the responsiveness of network protocols, the IETF 
			    concluded with their L4S and NQB work that there were fundamentally two types of Internet traffic 
			    and that these two major traffic types could benefit from having separate network processing queues 
			    in order to improve the way the Internet works for all applications, and especially for interactive applications.</t>
			    
			    <t>One of the two major traffic types is Queue Building (QB) - things like file downloads and 
				    backups that are designed utilize as much network capacity as possible but for which users 
				    are not interacting with in 
			    real-time. The other was Non-Queue-Building (NQB) - such as DNS lookups, voice interaction 
			    with artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, video conferencing, gaming, and so on. NQB 
			    flows tend to be limited in their capacity needs - for example a DNS lookup will not need to 
			    consume the full capacity of an end user's connection - but the end user is highly sensitive 
			    to any delays.</t>
			    
			    
				<t>Thus, the IETF created specifications for how two different network processing 
					queues can be designed and operated. Early results, such as from the IETF-114 hackathon 
					<xref target="IETF-114-Slides"/>, 
					demonstrate that L4S and NQB (a.k.a. dual queue networking, and simply "low latency networking" hereafter) can work 
					across a variety of access network technologies and deliver 
					extraordinary levels of responsiveness for a variety of applications. It seems likely that 
					this new capability will enable entirely new classes of applications to become possible, 
					driving a wave of new Internet innovation, while also improving the applications people use 
					today.</t>
					

	    </section>
	    
	    <section title="Network Neutrality and Low Latency Networking">
		    <t>Network Neutrality (a.k.a. Net Neutrality, and NN hereafter) is a concept that can mean a variety 
		    of things within a country, as well as between different countries, based on 
		    different opinions, market structures, business practices, laws, and regulations. Generally speaking, 
		    at least in the context of the United States' marketplace, it has 
		    come to mean that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should not block, throttle, or deprioritize 
		    lawful application traffic, and should not engage in paid prioritization, among other things. The meaning of NN 
		    can be complex and ever changing, so the specific details are out of scope for this document. 
		    Despite that, NN concerns certainly bear on the deployment of new technologies by ISPs, at least in the US, 
		    and so should be taken into account in making deployment design decisions. </t>
		    
		    <t>It is also possible that there can be confusion for people who are not deep in this highly technical subject 
			    between prioritization, provisioned 
		    end user capacity (throughput), and low latency networking. As it is envisioned in the design of the 
		    protocols, the addition of a low latency packet processing queue at a network link is merely a second 
		    packet queue and does not mean that this queue is prioritized or that it has different or greater 
		    capacity from the classic queue. Thus, a low latency queue does not create a so-called "fast lane" (in the way that 
		    this term is used in policy-related discussions in the U.S. to describe higher than best effort priority or greater capacity being assigned to some traffic compared to default traffic) - 
		    but there are certainly other NN considerations in the operational implementation worth exploring.</t>
		    
	    
			<section title="Prioritization: Same for All Traffic">
		    	<t>As noted above, a key aspect of NN goals is that traffic to certain Internet destinations or for certain 
			    applications should not be prioritized over other Internet traffic. This means in practice that all Internet traffic 
			    in an ISP network should be carried at the same (best effort) priority and that any network management practices 
			    imposed by the network should be protocol (application) agnostic. Low latency networking is fully consistent with this aspect of NN, 
			    because it is designed so that all traffic is treated on a best effort (BE) basis in the ISP network (this may not necessarily 
			    be the case for a user's in-home Wi-Fi network due to the particulars of how the IEEE 802.11 wireless protocol functions at the current 
			    time).</t>
			    
			    <t>In addition, as noted above, unlike with bandwidth priority on a highly/fully utilized link, low latency is not a zero sum game - everyone 
			can potentially have lower latency at no one else's expense.</t>
	    	</section>
	    
			<section title="Thoughput: Shared Across All Traffic">
		    	<t>Low latency networking is also consistent with the NN goal of not creating a fast lane, because the same end user 
			    	throughput in an ISP access network is shared between both classic and low latency (L4S/NQB) queues. Thus, 
			    	applications do not get access to greater or different throughput depending on whether or not the leverage 
			    	low latency networking.</t>
	    	</section>
	    	
	    	<section title="A New Network Capability - For All Networks">
		    	<t>Ultimately, the emergence of low latency networking represents a fundamental new network 
			    	capability that applications can choose to utilize as their needs dictate. It reflects a new ground truth 
			    	about two fundamentally different types of application traffic and demonstrates that networks 
			    	continue to evolve in exciting ways.</t>
				
				<t>In addition, this new network capability can be implemented in a variety of network technologies. For example in access network 
technologies this could be implemented in DOCSIS [ref needed], 5G [ref needed], PON [ref needed], and many other types of networks. Anywhere 
that a network bottleneck could occur may benefit from this technology.</t>
	    	</section>
	    
	    
	    </section>
	    
	    <section title="Recommended Deployment Design Decisions">
		    
		    <t>Like any network or system, a good deployment design and configuration matters and 
		    can be the difference between a well-functioning and accepted design and one that experiences 
		    problems and faces opposition. In the context of deploying low latency networking in an ISP network, 
		    this document describes some recommended deployment design decisions that should help 
		    to ensure a deployment is resilient, well-accepted, and creates the environment for generating 
		    strong network effects. In contrast, creating barriers to adoption in the early stages through design and 
		    policy decisions will presumably reduce the predicted potential network effect, thus choking off further 
		    investment across the Internet ecosystem, leading to a vicious circle of decline - and then the potential 
		    value is never realized.</t>
		    
	   
	    
	    <section title="Only Applications Mark Traffic">
		    
		    <t>Only applications should mark traffic, not the network. This is for several reasons:</t>
		    <ul>
		    <li>According to the end-to-end principle, this function is best delegated to the edge of 
		    the network as an architectural best practice (the edge being the application in this case).</li>
		    <li>Application marking maintains the loose coupling between the application and network layers, 
		    eliminating the need for close coordination between networks and application developers.</li>
		    <li>Application developers know best whether their application is compatible with low 
			    latency networking and which aspects of their traffic flows will or will not benefit.</li>
		    <li>Application traffic is almost entirely encrypted, which makes it very difficult for networks 
		    to accurately determine application protocols and to further infer which flows will benefit from low latency 
		    and which flows may be harmed because they need to build a queue.</li>
		    <li>To correctly utilize L4S, the application needs to use a scalable congestion control algorithm in order to 
			use the packet marking for L4S (DSCP mark). But only the application (not the network) knows what congestion control 
			it is using. So, with L4S, the network cannot properly mark on behalf of the application.</li>
		    <li>Network operators and equipment vendors attempting to infer application type and application need 
		    will always make mistakes, incorrectly classifying traffic <xref target="Lotus"/>, and potentially negatively 
		    affecting certain flows.</li>  
		    <li>The pace of innovation and iteration is necessarily faster-moving in the application edge at layer 7, 
		    rather than in the network at layer 3 (and below) - where there is greater standards stability and a lower rate of 
		    major changes. As a result, the application layer is best suited to rapid experimentation and iteration. Network 
		    operators and equipment vendors trying to infer application needs will in comparison always be in a reactive 
		    mode, one step behind changes made in applications.</li>

		    </ul>
		    
	    </section>
	    
	    
	    <section title="All Application Providers Welcome"> 
		    
		    <t>Any application provider should be able to mark their traffic for the low latency queue, with no restrictions 
		    other than standards compliance or other reasonable and openly documented technical guidelines. This 
		    maintains the loose cross-layer coupling that is a key tenet of the Internet's architecture by eliminating 
		    or greatly reducing any need for application providers and networks to coordinate on deployment (though 
		    such coordination is normal in the early experimental phase of any deployment).</t>
		    
		    <t>As noted above, this is another example that low latency networking will have strong network 
		    effects, any barriers to adoption such as this should be avoided in order to maximize the value to users 
		    and the network of a new low latency queue.</t> 
		    
	    </section>
	    
	    <section title="End User CPE Choice"> 
		    
		   <t>Both customer-owned and leased end user Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) should be supported. This avoids the risk that an ISP can be 
		   perceived as giving preference to their own network demarcation devices, which may carry some monthly recurring fee or other 
		   cost. This also means that retail CPE manufacturers need to make the necessary development investment to 
		   correctly implement low latency networking, though this may not interest or may be outside the capabilities of some organizations.
		   In any case, the more devices that implement then adoption is broader, positively driving network effects.</t>
		   
	    </section>
			

			
	    <section title="Opt Out During Experimental Phase">
		    <t>In early phases of deployment of low latency networking, ISPs should consider making available some 
			    mechanism for users to opt out of (deactivate) it. If low latency networking is working correctly, it seems extremely 
			    unlikely that a user should ever want or need to turn it off. But is is also possible that it may be desirable 
			    in some troubleshooting situations to turn it off, such as in in cases where a particular application has incorrectly 
			    implemented low latency networking and the developer is working on a bug fix for an extended period of time. 
			    As application use of this technology matures, it seems likely that there will not be a long term need or 
			    practical benefit to having an opt out mechanism (and it may be counter productive if it insulates developers from 
			    having to fix bugs or misconfigurations in their software).</t>
	    </section>
			
			<section title="Consider Traffic Protection">
				<t>The specifications in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb"/> describe a concept of Traffic Protection, also known as a Queue Protection Function [ref]. The document says that Traffic Protection is optional and may not be needed in certain networks. In the case of an ISP deploying low latency networking with two queues, an ISP should consider deploying such a network function to at least detect mismarking (if not necessarily to correct mismarking). This may be 
implemented for example in end user CPE, last mile network equipment, and/or elsewhere in the ISP network - or closely monitors network statistics and user feedback for any indication of widespread NQB packet mismarking by applications.</t>
			</section>	
	  
	 </section>
	  
	 <section title="Summary of Recommended Deployment Design Decisions">
		 
		 <ol type="%d">
			 
		 	<li>Only Applications Mark Traffic: Not the network</li>
		 	<li>All Application Providers Welcome: Any application provider can mark with no restrictions other than standards compliance
