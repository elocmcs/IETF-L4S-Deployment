	<t>This document explores the potential implications of key deployment design decisions and makes 
	recommendations for those decisions. In particular, there are best practices based on prior experience 
	as a network operator that should be considered and there are network neutrality types of considerations 
	as well. Technologies like L4S are benign on their own, but the way they are operationally implemented can 
	determine whether they are ultimately perceived positively and adopted by the broader Internet ecosystem. 
	That is a key issue with L4S, because the more applications developers and edge platforms that adopt it then 
	the greater the value to end users.</t>

    <section title="Network Neutrality Overview" anchor="NN">
	    <t>Network Neutrality (aka Net Neutrality, and NN hereafter) is a concept that can mean a variety 
	    of things in different countries, based on their laws and regulations. Generally speaking it has 
	    come to mean that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should not block, throttle, or deprioritize 
	    lawful application traffic, should not engage in paid prioritization, and so on. The meaning of NN 
	    can be complex and ever changing, so the specific details are out of scope for this document.</t>
	    
	    <t>That being said, NN concerns certainly bear on the deployment of L4S by ISPs and so should be 
	    taken into account. It is also possible that there can be confusion over prioritization, provisioned 
	    end user throughput capacity, and low latency networking. As it is envisioned in the design of the 
	    protocol, the addition of a low latency packet processing queue at a network link is merely a second 
	    packet queue and does not mean that this queue is prioritized or that it has different or greater 
	    capacity from the classic queue. Thus, a low latency queue does not create a so-called "fast lane" - 
	    but there are other NN considerations in the operational implementation.</t>

    </section>
    
    <section title="Only Applications Mark Traffic" anchor="Marking">
	    
	    <t>Only applications should mark traffic, not the network. This is for several reasons:
	    <list style="symbols">
	    <t>According to the end-to-end principle, this function is best delegated to the edge of 
	    the network as an architectural best practice.</t>
	    <t>Application marking maintains the loose coupling between the application and network layers, 
	    eliminating the need for close coordination between networks and application developers.</t>
	    <t>Application developers know best whether their application will benefit from low latency and 
	    which aspects of their traffic flows will or will not benefit.</t>
	    <t>Application traffic is almost entirely encrypted, which makes it very difficult for networks 
	    to determine application protocols and to further infer which flows will benefit from low latency 
	    and which flows may be harmed because they need to build a queue.</t>
	    <t>Network operators and equipment vendors attempting to infer application type and application need 
	    will always make mistakes, incorrectly classifying traffic (REF TO NOTES) and potentially negatively 
	    affecting certain flows.</t>  
	    <t>The pace of innovation and iteration is necessarily faster-moving at the application edge at layer 7, 
	    rather than in the network at layer 3 where there is greater standards stability and a lower rate of 
	    major changes. As a result, the application layer is best suited to such experimentation. Network 
	    operators and equipment vendors trying to infer application needs will in addition always be in a reactive 
	    mode, one step behind changes made in applications.</t>
	    </list></t>
	    
    </section>
    
    <section title="No Provider Payments" anchor="Payments"> 
	    
	    <t>There should be no edge provider payments for low latency marking by itself. A key point of NN 
	    sensitivity pertains to the potential gatekeeping and barrier to entry effects of payments from edge 
	    providers to ISPs for access to the low latency queue or other specialized services. This is because it 
	    can put the ISP in the role of being perceived as picking winners and losers in the application space but 
	    it can also create barriers to entry for new developers because established developers may be the only 
	    ones able to afford such payments.</t>
	    
	    <t>In addition, given that low latency marking will have strong network effects, any barriers to adoption 
	    such as this should be avoided in order to maximize the value to users and the network of a low latency 
	    queue.</t>
	    
    </section>
    
    <section title="All Providers Welcome" anchor="Welcome"> 
	    
	    <t>Any provider should be able to mark their traffic for the low latency queue, with no restrictions 
	    other than standards compliance or other reasonable and openly documented technical guidelines. This 
	    maintains the loose cross-layer coupling that is a key tenet of the Internet's architecture by eliminating 
	    or greatly reducing any need for application providers and networks to coordinate on deployment (though 
	    such coordination is normal in the early experimental phase of any deployment).</t>
	    
	    <t>As noted above, this is another example that given low latency marking will have strong network 
	    effects, any barriers to adoption such as this should be avoided in order to maximize the value to users 
	    and the network of a low latency queue.</t> 
	    
    </section>
    
    <section title="Device Choice" anchor="DeviceChoice"> 
	    
	   <t>Both customer-owned and leased devices should be supported. This avoids the risk that an ISP can be 
	   perceived as giving preference to their own devices, which may carry some monthly recurring fee or other 
	   cost. It also ensures the broadest possible base of adoption, driving network effects.</t>
	   
    </section>
    
    <section title="User Choice" anchor"UserChoice">
	    <t>Users should have a mechanism to opt out or opt in to low latency networking. If low latency 
	    networking is working correctly, it seems unlikely that a user should ever want or need to turn it 
	    off. But is is also possible it may be desirable in some troubleshooting situations or even in cases 
	    where a particular application that a user depends upon has not implemented low latency networking 
	    correctly and so the user wishes to turn it off until the developer can fix the problem.</t>
