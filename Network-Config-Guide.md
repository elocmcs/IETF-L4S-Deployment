This document is a guide to developers that would like to implement the IETF's Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S) standard. 
This is a new way to handle traffic flows that are latency sensitive by creating a second network queue at bottlenecks; one for classic traffic 
and one for low latency traffic. 

See also the [Application Developer Guide](https://github.com/jlivingood/IETF-L4S-Deployment/blob/main/App-Developer-Guide.md) and [Low Latency Deployment Design Recommendations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-livingood-low-latency-deployment/)
