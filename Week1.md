# Week 1 - Field Trial Instructions

Welcome to the first week of testing and thank you for volunteering to help us test low latency networking! If you have previously participated in our trials we ask that you repeat the exercises in our upcoming weeks.

## Action Requested
Your cable modem has been provisioned with a low latency bootfile. All weâ€™d like you to do this week is use the internet as usual - but report any SIGNIFICANT performance problems you may notice. Our objective is to ensure no configuration errors have been made on our end, and that all of your usual applications work as usual. Those errors will not typically be subtle - so we really only need to know about major issues like your internet connection has slowed to dial-up speeds.
